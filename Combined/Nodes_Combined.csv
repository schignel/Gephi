N01,Nature,Tropical and Subtropical Dry and Humid Forests,"*Main description: Includes humid and dry broadleaf forests centered between the tropics and at subtropical latitudes, and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests. Humid forests are characterized by low variability in annual temperature and high levels of rainfall (>2000 mm annually); forest composition is dominated by evergreen and semi-evergreen tree species. Dry forests occur in climates that are mostly warm year-round, with annual rainfall ranging from 200 to 1500 mm. There is a well-defined dry season which can last several months and vary with geographic location. Semi-deciduous and deciduous trees predominate in these forests. Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests are found predominantly in North and Central America. They experience low levels of precipitation and moderate variability in temperature. They are characterized by diverse species of conifers, whose needles are adapted to deal with the variable climatic conditions.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1

N03,Nature,"Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub","*Main description: Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions are characterized by hot and dry summers, while winters tend to be cool and moist. Most precipitation arrives during these months. Although the habitat is globally rare, it features an extraordinary biodiversity of uniquely adapted animal and plant species, which can adapt to the stressful conditions of long, hot summers with little rain. Most plants are fire adapted, and dependent on this disturbance for their persistence. The Mediterranean unit of analysis is discontinuous, spread across five continents and 22 countries: Europe and Africa in the Mediterranean Basin, the western United States (California) and Mexico (northwest Baja), South America in central Chile, the cape region of South Africa, and south and southwestern Australia",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N04,Nature,Tundra and High Mountain Habitats,"*Main description: the tundra comprises the vast, nearly level, treeless plains of the arctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It consists of a black mucky soil with a permanently frozen subsoil (permafrost), and has a dominant vegetation of mosses, lichens, herbs, and dwarf shrubs. This unit also includes high mountainous areas above the timber line. However, high mountains are not precisely defined, and for purposes of this Unit, they are defined as mountains greater than 2000 m altitude and above.

N05,Nature,Tropical and Subtropical Savannas and Grasslands,"*Main description: Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands and Savannas are characterized by rainfall levels between 300-1500 mm per year. However, there may be great variability in soil moisture throughout the year. In general, grasses dominate the species composition of these ecoregions, although scattered trees may be common. Large mammals that have evolved to take advantage of the ample forage typify the biodiversity associated with these habitats.
*Other UoAs: subtropical shrublands (which are included in Olson et al., 2001) are included in UoA7 (Deserts and Xeric shrublands). Some parts of these two units may overlap, as it is common for some areas of the subtropical savannas to be described as xerophytic shrublands.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1

N12,Nature,Aquaculture Areas,"*Main description: Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. Aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable as a common property resources, with or without appropriate licenses, are the harvest of fisheries. Aquaculture areas are thus any area of land, freshwater or marine water that is used in the production of cultured organisms.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1

*Other UoAs: borders on the open ocean (UoA15) at its outer boundary and may (see*Additional notes/inclusions) touch on the deep ocean (UoA16) in some locations; inshore regions with permanent ice are placed in the cryosphere (UOA11), floating above, or beside, UoA14; freshwater coastal rivers/lakes (UoA13-Inland surface waters and water bodies/freshwater) may form a boundary with estuaries; shelf systems intensively/multiply used by man are separated from this unit into “Hotspots of endemic species” section.
*Additional notes/exceptions/inclusions:
- Inner-shelf depressions (over deepened basins) can be deeper but belong to the shelf (canyons being open to the deep-sea belong to UoA 16). 
- depth may extend to <500 m around Antarctica and Antarctic islands close to the continent, no Sub-Antarctic islands

N15,Nature,Open Ocean Pelagic Systems (Euphotic Zone),"*Main description:Upper light-flooded (euphotic) layer of the off-shore open ocean beyond the 200-m depth contour on the seabed (beyond 500m in Antarctica), where phytoplankton grow (=Net Primary Production). Its lower limit is the compensation depth roughly at 200m water depth (for scientific definition see e.g. Kaiser et al. 2005).
*Other UoAs:Open ocean pelagic systems (UoA 15) gradually turns to the dark pelagic zones (UoA 16) below and is linked to the deep sea-floor by biogeochemical pelagic-benthic coupling and vertical migration of organisms. The cryosphere (UoA 11) includes ice shelves, but the sea below or adjacent to them falls into UoA15 or UoA16 (according to depth). Also the boundary between upper light-flooded (euphotic) layer of the off-shore open ocean (UoA 15) and the shelf ecosystems (UoA 14) represents gradients in various ecologically relevant environmental parameters rather than discrete transitions.

N16,Nature,Deep Sea,"*Main description: Dark off-shore open ocean beyond the 200m depth contour on the seabed (beyond 500m in Antarctica), and greater than 200m deep (500m in Antarctica), below the euphotic zone (UoA 15), including the sea-floor and the dark pelagic zones (e.g. Seibold & Berger 1996, Gage & Tyler 1992, Kaiser et al. 2005, Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2010, Harris et al. 2014).
Boundary between UoA 15 and UoA 16 at approx. 200m is of significant ecological but low physiological relevance since species are specifically adapted to pressure (http://www.marinespecies.org/deepsea/). These two layers are directly linked through pelagic-benthic biogeochemical coupling and vertical migration of pelagic organisms. The cryosphere (UoA 11) includes ice shelves, but the sea below or adjacent to them falls into UoA15 or UoA16 (according to depth).

N17,Nature,Coastal Areas Intensively and Multiply Used By Human,"*Main description: This Unit of Analysis is restricted to artificial constructions on the coastline and in coastal waters, focused on physical rather than biological function and attributes. It includes: a) Coastal Defense Schemes: Breakwaters, Groynes and Jetties; b) Coastal Erosion Schemes: Seawalls, Bulkheads; c) infrastructure protection schemes: Pilings; d) Floating docks to create boating facilities; e) artificial islands; f) dumping and mining areas; and g) port development and coastal support facilities (as required by four types of activities: 1) offshore oil and gas development requires port facilities, oil storage capacity, refineries and other infrastructure support; 2) the shipping industry requires channels, port facilities, shipyards and extensive land areas for container storage; 3) fisheries development requires breakwaters, channels, ports, processing plants and other facilities for the fishing fleet; and 4) military operations will require port facilities, infrastructure, and support services).
*Other UoAs:heavily altered and multiply used areas that are focused on biological function for aquaculture are included in UOA 12, Aquaculture areas. There may be some difficulty in separating this UOA from UOA 9, Urban/semi-urban, as many of the structures defined here will be contiguous with UOA9.*Additional notes/exceptions/inclusions: Currently, 2.5 billion people (40% of the world’s population) live within 100 km of the coast, adding increased pressure to coastal areas. The term coastal zone means the coastal waters (including the lands therein and thereunder) and the adjacent shore lands (including the waters therein and thereunder), in proximity to the shorelines of the land includes islands, transitional and inter-tidal areas, salt marshes, wetlands, and beaches (NOAA). The coastal zone is used extensively for a large number of human activities. The shoreline boundary is used for human settlement, agriculture, trade, industry and amenity. The coastal sea is intensively used for transport, fishing, dumping, mining, etc., stemming from an intensification and diversification of ocean uses. There is overexploitation of fishery resources as well as pollution by dumping (Clark, 1991c). Coastal zones are the “sink” for the continents; they receive and concentrate pollutants and other negative consequences of development activities taking place in the hinterlands. Coastal development linked to human settlements, industry, aquaculture, or infrastructure causes severe impacts on coastal areas.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1

D03,Driving Forces,Pollution (The Level Of ~),"Contamination or undesirable modification of soil, water, the atmosphere, food or living space by a noxious or toxic substance, noise or light. Pollution comprises
• deliberate emissions into an ecosystem such as surplus amounts of agrochemicals into gardens and agro-ecosystems, or de-icing products on roads, affecting soil, ground water and biodiversity,
• spill-over of substances from the target ecosystem (where they may be harmless or useful) to sensitive ecosystems (e.g. run-off from adjacent land areas into limnic or marine ecosystems),
• disposal or deposition of effluents, e.g. industrial pollution of soil, water or air (other than emission of greenhouse gases) or garbage disposal.",#928b8b,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
D04,Driving Forces,Land Use Changes (The Intensity Of ~),"Changes in the kind of use, or the intensity of use of terrestrial, limnic and marine ecosystems (e.g. intensification or extensification of agriculture, fishing vs. overfishing) affecting global nature, nature’s contributions to people and a good quality of life in a positive or negative direction. This includes 
* landscape/seascape transformations (transformations into a different kind of ecosystem, causing irreversible or at least significant and long lasting changes to nature, nature’s contributions to people (changes of contributions and of beneficiaries) and a the quality of life); 
* cultivation intensity changes (the kind of use remains basically the same (agriculture, forestry, leisure, etc.), but the use intensity increases or decreases as a direct result of human management decisions); 
* direct exploitation and extraction (as in ecosystem products, surface and ground water resources, etc).",#928b8b,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
D05,Driving Forces,Invasive Alien Species (The Number Of ~),"Alterations in the large scale distribution of organisms 
• purposeful introduction of organisms, including those considered invasive (e.g. for leisure or decorational purposes)
• unintentional introduction of species and varieties, including those considered invasive (e.g. dispersion by global trade)
• spread of zoonoses, pathogens, agents of disease

D12,Driving Forces,"Regional Conflicts, Wars (The Number & Severity Of ~)","While the motivations of agents vary (e.g. resource control, political control, territorial enclosure, regime change), civil conflicts most often begin with the exclusion of social groups by majorities or power holders, denying them, amongst other rights, access to infrastructure and public services (water, energy, sewage, garbage collection). Such conflicts can escalate into violence by suppression or by resistance, or both, resulting in severe social and environmental impacts, human suffering and conflict-driven migration. When conflicts turn violent, nature (in the vast majority of cases) and humans suffer alike: war is the ultimate unsustainability. Nature, nature’s benefits to people and good quality of life tend to suffer significantly in both cases.",#928b8b,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
D13,Driving Forces,"Production Patterns (The Degree Of ""Globalistaion"")","Patterns of production comprise the kinds of products produced and the means (technologies, work organisation, resources used incl. energy) of doing so. Patterns of supply refer to the sourcing of inputs, local vs. global, and the kind of supply chains involved. Patterns of consumption comprise both the level of consumption and the composition of consumption.",#928b8b,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
