N01,Nature,Tropical and Subtropical Dry and Humid Forests,"*Main description: Includes humid and dry broadleaf forests centered between the tropics and at subtropical latitudes, and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests. Humid forests are characterized by low variability in annual temperature and high levels of rainfall (>2000 mm annually); forest composition is dominated by evergreen and semi-evergreen tree species. Dry forests occur in climates that are mostly warm year-round, with annual rainfall ranging from 200 to 1500 mm. There is a well-defined dry season which can last several months and vary with geographic location. Semi-deciduous and deciduous trees predominate in these forests. Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests are found predominantly in North and Central America. They experience low levels of precipitation and moderate variability in temperature. They are characterized by diverse species of conifers, whose needles are adapted to deal with the variable climatic conditions.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1

N03,Nature,"Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub","*Main description: Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions are characterized by hot and dry summers, while winters tend to be cool and moist. Most precipitation arrives during these months. Although the habitat is globally rare, it features an extraordinary biodiversity of uniquely adapted animal and plant species, which can adapt to the stressful conditions of long, hot summers with little rain. Most plants are fire adapted, and dependent on this disturbance for their persistence. The Mediterranean unit of analysis is discontinuous, spread across five continents and 22 countries: Europe and Africa in the Mediterranean Basin, the western United States (California) and Mexico (northwest Baja), South America in central Chile, the cape region of South Africa, and south and southwestern Australia",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N04,Nature,Tundra and High Mountain Habitats,"*Main description: the tundra comprises the vast, nearly level, treeless plains of the arctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It consists of a black mucky soil with a permanently frozen subsoil (permafrost), and has a dominant vegetation of mosses, lichens, herbs, and dwarf shrubs. This unit also includes high mountainous areas above the timber line. However, high mountains are not precisely defined, and for purposes of this Unit, they are defined as mountains greater than 2000 m altitude and above.
*Other UoAs: this unit is distinguished from the cryosphere as being characterized by vegetation cover.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N05,Nature,Tropical and Subtropical Savannas and Grasslands,"*Main description: Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands and Savannas are characterized by rainfall levels between 300-1500 mm per year. However, there may be great variability in soil moisture throughout the year. In general, grasses dominate the species composition of these ecoregions, although scattered trees may be common. Large mammals that have evolved to take advantage of the ample forage typify the biodiversity associated with these habitats.
*Other UoAs: subtropical shrublands (which are included in Olson et al., 2001) are included in UoA7 (Deserts and Xeric shrublands). Some parts of these two units may overlap, as it is common for some areas of the subtropical savannas to be described as xerophytic shrublands.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N06,Nature,Temperate Grasslands,"*Main description: Temperate grasslands occur where seasonal climates and soils favour the dominance of perennial grasses and related life forms. They are distributed mainly in the middle latitudes with differing names across continents. Steppes, prairies, pampas, and veld areas, but also including (semi-) natural (ancient or primary) grasslands and forest-steppes, wood-pastures, “temperate savannas” and open shrublands(?) in the regions of Temperate and Boreal broadleaved, mixed and coniferous forests, Mediterranean regions and of mountains below the timberline, excluding tundra grasslands, subtropical grasslands and savannas, deserts and xeric shrublands, and grasslands above the timberline, and also excluding intensively managed, improved agricultural grasslands.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1

N08,Nature,"Wetlands (Peatlands, Mires, Bogs)","*Main description: Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year. Water saturation by groundwater, precipitation, surface waters and ocean tides largely determines how frequently or continually the soil is inundated and develops and the types of plant and animal communities living in and on the soil. Includes natural and constructed permanent forest covered inland marshes and wet meadows (dominated by herbaceous plants), swamps (dominated by shrubs), wooded swamps (dominated by trees), seasonal freshwater wetlands (playa lakes, vernal pools, potholes, marshes), seawater and freshwater tidal swamps and marshes (linked to estuaries or beyond the upper edges of tidal salt marshes where the influence of salt water ends), and unforested mires such as bogs, fens and other peatlands.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1

N10,Nature,Cultivated Areas,"*Main description: Cultivated systems can be defined as areas in which at least 30% of the landscape is in croplands, shifting cultivation, confined livestock production, or freshwater aquaculture in any year",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N11,Nature,Cryosphere,"*Main description: The cryosphere consists of regions where water exists primarily in a frozen state most of the time, i.e. the polar regions, glaciers and alpine regions. Contains many highly unique habitats / ecosystems such as sea ice, ice shelfs, areas with permafrost, the extreme cold and dry regions of the Antarctica including the Antarctic dry valleys and the sub-glacial/ice sheet lakes (ex. Lake Vostok).",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N12,Nature,Aquaculture Areas,"*Main description: Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. Aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable as a common property resources, with or without appropriate licenses, are the harvest of fisheries. Aquaculture areas are thus any area of land, freshwater or marine water that is used in the production of cultured organisms.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N13,Nature,Inland Surface Waters and Water Bodies/Freshwater,"*Main description: Inland waters are permanent above-ground open fresh or brackish water bodies inland from the coastal zone and areas, including their littoral zones. Includes natural (lakes, rivers, streams, springs, water courses, deltas, inland saline systems, and bays nearest to the shore of a nation and are subject to its complete sovereignty) and constructed (reservoirs, ponds, pools) permanent water bodies which support a natural community of both plants and animals. Littoral zones include those parts of banks or shores that are sufficiently frequently inundated to prevent the formation of closed terrestrial vegetation",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N14,Nature,Shelf Ecosystems (Neritic and Intertidal/Littoral Zone),"*Main description: In-shore pelagic and benthic systems extending from the coastline to the 200m depth contour. At the coastal boundary, includes the intertidal/littoral zone to the Mean High Tide Water Line including estuaries to their inner boundary (approx. 5%o, see Wolanski 2007).
*Other UoAs: borders on the open ocean (UoA15) at its outer boundary and may (see*Additional notes/inclusions) touch on the deep ocean (UoA16) in some locations; inshore regions with permanent ice are placed in the cryosphere (UOA11), floating above, or beside, UoA14; freshwater coastal rivers/lakes (UoA13-Inland surface waters and water bodies/freshwater) may form a boundary with estuaries; shelf systems intensively/multiply used by man are separated from this unit into “Hotspots of endemic species” section.
*Additional notes/exceptions/inclusions:
- Inner-shelf depressions (over deepened basins) can be deeper but belong to the shelf (canyons being open to the deep-sea belong to UoA 16). 
- depth may extend to <500 m around Antarctica and Antarctic islands close to the continent, no Sub-Antarctic islands 
- Sub-units of analysis: a) mangrove forests are included as they are in the littoral zone and estuaries (Olds et al 2015, UNEP_WCMC mangrove layer) b) seagrass meadows (Orth et al 2006, UNEP_WCMC seagrass layer) c) tidal flats & salt marshes are in the littoral zone/estuaries (Orth et al 2006, UNEP_WCMC saltmarsh layer) d) rocky and sandy shores incl. tide pools, are in the littoral zone. e) kelp forests (Steneck et al. 2002), f) coral and other biogenic reefs (UNEP_WCMC coral reef layer) g) soft and poorly sorted bottoms incl. over deepened troughs with overlying water body. h) deltas and estuaries - high in population",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
N15,Nature,Open Ocean Pelagic Systems (Euphotic Zone),"*Main description:Upper light-flooded (euphotic) layer of the off-shore open ocean beyond the 200-m depth contour on the seabed (beyond 500m in Antarctica), where phytoplankton grow (=Net Primary Production). Its lower limit is the compensation depth roughly at 200m water depth (for scientific definition see e.g. Kaiser et al. 2005).
*Other UoAs:Open ocean pelagic systems (UoA 15) gradually turns to the dark pelagic zones (UoA 16) below and is linked to the deep sea-floor by biogeochemical pelagic-benthic coupling and vertical migration of organisms. The cryosphere (UoA 11) includes ice shelves, but the sea below or adjacent to them falls into UoA15 or UoA16 (according to depth). Also the boundary between upper light-flooded (euphotic) layer of the off-shore open ocean (UoA 15) and the shelf ecosystems (UoA 14) represents gradients in various ecologically relevant environmental parameters rather than discrete transitions.
*Additional notes/exceptions/inclusions:
- Sub-units of analysis: a) central oceanic gyres incl. Sargasso Sea and Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Longhurst 1998), b) High-Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll systems (World Ocean Assessment 2016, World Ocean Atlas 2009, 2013, SeaWiFS), c) cold ice-covered polar seas (Orsi et al 1995, International Hydrographic Organization 2001), d) upwelling systems including predominantly pelagic Oxygen Minimum Zones, both partly also occur on shelves (UoA 14) and affect the deep sea-floor (UoA 16); Easter Boundary Upwelling: Gómez-Gesteira et al (2008), Capone & Hutchins (2013), equatorial upwelling and at ocean frontal systems: http://www.marinebio.net/marinescience/02ocean/swmovement.htm, http://www.seos-project.eu/modules/oceancurrents/oceancurrents-c04-p04.html, Gordon et al 1977) also in gyres.

N16,Nature,Deep Sea,"*Main description: Dark off-shore open ocean beyond the 200m depth contour on the seabed (beyond 500m in Antarctica), and greater than 200m deep (500m in Antarctica), below the euphotic zone (UoA 15), including the sea-floor and the dark pelagic zones (e.g. Seibold & Berger 1996, Gage & Tyler 1992, Kaiser et al. 2005, Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2010, Harris et al. 2014).
Boundary between UoA 15 and UoA 16 at approx. 200m is of significant ecological but low physiological relevance since species are specifically adapted to pressure (http://www.marinespecies.org/deepsea/). These two layers are directly linked through pelagic-benthic biogeochemical coupling and vertical migration of pelagic organisms. The cryosphere (UoA 11) includes ice shelves, but the sea below or adjacent to them falls into UoA15 or UoA16 (according to depth).
*Additional notes/exceptions/inclusions:
- Sub-units of analysis: a) slope and rise of continents and islands incl. canyons, 200-2000m and 2000 - 4000m along continents, respectively b) abyssal plains (4000 - 6000m sounding depth) including mid-ocean ridges (usually: 5000-2500m sounding depth; https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/baseball.html https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/crustageposter.gif and Gubbins 2008, according to crust age. Sub-UoA 16e overlaps with shelf ecosystems (UoA 14), where mid-ocean ridges hit continents. c) vents and seeps (German et al. 2011; rarely also on shelves: UoA 14), d) seamounts (Clark et al. 2010, 2011), e) cold coral reefs (World Ocean Assessment 2016, Freiwald et al. 2004, Roberts et al. 2010; also on shelves: UoA 14 and 17, f) deep-sea trenches (8-45° slopes, 6000 - 11000m sounding depth) g) dark (aphotic) pelagic zone, incl. meso- (20-1000m), bathy (1000-4000m), abyss (4000-6000m), and hado- (6000-11000m) pelagic zones (Kaiser et al. 2005).

N17,Nature,Coastal Areas Intensively and Multiply Used By Human,"*Main description: This Unit of Analysis is restricted to artificial constructions on the coastline and in coastal waters, focused on physical rather than biological function and attributes. It includes: a) Coastal Defense Schemes: Breakwaters, Groynes and Jetties; b) Coastal Erosion Schemes: Seawalls, Bulkheads; c) infrastructure protection schemes: Pilings; d) Floating docks to create boating facilities; e) artificial islands; f) dumping and mining areas; and g) port development and coastal support facilities (as required by four types of activities: 1) offshore oil and gas development requires port facilities, oil storage capacity, refineries and other infrastructure support; 2) the shipping industry requires channels, port facilities, shipyards and extensive land areas for container storage; 3) fisheries development requires breakwaters, channels, ports, processing plants and other facilities for the fishing fleet; and 4) military operations will require port facilities, infrastructure, and support services).
*Other UoAs:heavily altered and multiply used areas that are focused on biological function for aquaculture are included in UOA 12, Aquaculture areas. There may be some difficulty in separating this UOA from UOA 9, Urban/semi-urban, as many of the structures defined here will be contiguous with UOA9.*Additional notes/exceptions/inclusions: Currently, 2.5 billion people (40% of the world’s population) live within 100 km of the coast, adding increased pressure to coastal areas. The term coastal zone means the coastal waters (including the lands therein and thereunder) and the adjacent shore lands (including the waters therein and thereunder), in proximity to the shorelines of the land includes islands, transitional and inter-tidal areas, salt marshes, wetlands, and beaches (NOAA). The coastal zone is used extensively for a large number of human activities. The shoreline boundary is used for human settlement, agriculture, trade, industry and amenity. The coastal sea is intensively used for transport, fishing, dumping, mining, etc., stemming from an intensification and diversification of ocean uses. There is overexploitation of fishery resources as well as pollution by dumping (Clark, 1991c). Coastal zones are the “sink” for the continents; they receive and concentrate pollutants and other negative consequences of development activities taking place in the hinterlands. Coastal development linked to human settlements, industry, aquaculture, or infrastructure causes severe impacts on coastal areas.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/on9920e9edhjdtv/Nature.png?raw=1
