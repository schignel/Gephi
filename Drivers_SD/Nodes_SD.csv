• ocean acidification, 
• changing temperature and precipitation patterns, 
• destabilisation of weather patterns and 
• changes in the frequency and strength of extreme weather events",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
D03,Driving Forces,Pollution (The Level Of ~),"Contamination or undesirable modification of soil, water, the atmosphere, food or living space by a noxious or toxic substance, noise or light. Pollution comprises
• deliberate emissions into an ecosystem such as surplus amounts of agrochemicals into gardens and agro-ecosystems, or de-icing products on roads, affecting soil, ground water and biodiversity,
• spill-over of substances from the target ecosystem (where they may be harmless or useful) to sensitive ecosystems (e.g. run-off from adjacent land areas into limnic or marine ecosystems),
• disposal or deposition of effluents, e.g. industrial pollution of soil, water or air (other than emission of greenhouse gases) or garbage disposal.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
D04,Driving Forces,Land Use Changes (The Intensity Of ~),"Changes in the kind of use, or the intensity of use of terrestrial, limnic and marine ecosystems (e.g. intensification or extensification of agriculture, fishing vs. overfishing) affecting global nature, nature’s contributions to people and a good quality of life in a positive or negative direction. This includes 
* landscape/seascape transformations (transformations into a different kind of ecosystem, causing irreversible or at least significant and long lasting changes to nature, nature’s contributions to people (changes of contributions and of beneficiaries) and a the quality of life); 
* cultivation intensity changes (the kind of use remains basically the same (agriculture, forestry, leisure, etc.), but the use intensity increases or decreases as a direct result of human management decisions); 
* direct exploitation and extraction (as in ecosystem products, surface and ground water resources, etc).",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
D05,Driving Forces,Invasive Alien Species (The Number Of ~),"Alterations in the large scale distribution of organisms

D12,Driving Forces,"Regional Conflicts, Wars (The Number & Severity Of ~)","While the motivations of agents vary (e.g. resource control, political control, territorial enclosure, regime change), civil conflicts most often begin with the exclusion of social groups by majorities or power holders, denying them, amongst other rights, access to infrastructure and public services (water, energy, sewage, garbage collection). Such conflicts can escalate into violence by suppression or by resistance, or both, resulting in severe social and environmental impacts, human suffering and conflict-driven migration. When conflicts turn violent, nature (in the vast majority of cases) and humans suffer alike: war is the ultimate unsustainability. Nature, nature’s benefits to people and good quality of life tend to suffer significantly in both cases.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
D13,Driving Forces,"Production Patterns (The Degree Of ""Globalistaion"")","Patterns of production comprise the kinds of products produced and the means (technologies, work organisation, resources used incl. energy) of doing so. Patterns of supply refer to the sourcing of inputs, local vs. global, and the kind of supply chains involved. Patterns of consumption comprise both the level of consumption and the composition of consumption.",#000000,https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwl6bbdn6gflr8/Driving_Forces.png?raw=1
